If you have moved the location of your Malleus deck, consider changing the value of `deck_name` to the current location in your deck:

```
    "deck_name": "Pre-Made Decks::Malleus Medicine"
```

The `cache_expiry` is used to determine when the database should be synced with the database at malleuscm.notion.site in days

Generally the lower the better as you will be able to stay up to date with the database, but you can increase it if you find that it is bothering you.

`shorcut` is the keyboard shortcut is used to open the amlleus page selector.

`search_delay` is the delay before the search is automatically performed

`autosearch` is whether you want the auto search implementation to be on or off
