### Manual Installation

1.  Download the extension files
2.  Run the `update_notion_cache.py` python script (takes a little bit of time)
3.  Place them in your Anki addons folder:

# Configuration

If you have renamed or moved the Malleus deck it is worthwhile to change `deck_name` in the add on configuration manager to the correct name. This way the create card button will open to the correct deck.

The `cache_expiry` is the number of days after which the local database copy of the notion database will expire and any pages updated since the local database copy will be updated.

# Directions for the Future

-   [X] Add button in editor page
-   [X] Publish to Ankiweb addons
-   [X] Keep local cache and update only newly updated
-   [-] Add configuration for:
    -   [ ] Keybindings
    -   [X] Default deck location
    -   [X] Cache expiry duration
-   [ ] Add eTG database

## Troubleshooting

This extension requires access to the internet to use the notion API. Please ensure you are using it while connected to the internet.

There are some issues when trying to use the add-on while the database is being updated. Try re-installing the addon if issues occur.

## Limitations

I have not yet implemented full database syncs into the add on. Full database syncs can take a bit of time unfortunately and I will update the cache and re-upload the Anki addon when this occurs. I could consider writing a script in python to do this on a publicly hosted github repository and then the cache can be downloaded the cache from there.
